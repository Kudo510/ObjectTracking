# Multiple Object Tracking (MOT)

In this project, we created a tracker using a ReID model for precise appearance-based matching. Our tracker incorporates Faster R-CNN as the object detector. The ReID model is based on ResNet-34, trained with Triplet Loss and Cross-Entropy Loss. Its performance is evaluated using cosine distance measurements.
